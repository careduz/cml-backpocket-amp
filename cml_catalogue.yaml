    long_description: >-
      Create Atlas entities from the open data catalogues from the governments of 
      Canada, Ontario, and Toronto. The idea is to demonstrate how data sources external
      to the Cloudera Data Platform can be catalogued, filtered, and then consumed for 
      further analysis and experimentation.
